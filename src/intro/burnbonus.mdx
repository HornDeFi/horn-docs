# What is the burn HORN option on my pool deposit and why should i use it?

- Once you're in a pool you can burn any of your already owned <i>Horn</i> to increase your total percent share on the pool, which mean that
  you will <b>win more</b> from every new deposit fees then others members in that pool.

- Your burned <i>Horn</i> is represented and converted as a percent share of the pool asset, which mean that if you enter into the pool DAI with <b>100 DAI</b>:
  with a rate of 1 HORN : 5 DAI, if you burn <b>1 horn</b> into the pool you're percent share will be <b>105 DAI</b> and therefore increase your rewards on
  new outsiders deposit fees.
