# How the referral system works ?

<br/>
<hr/>

- When you invite new members on Horn, you increase your profits from the deposit fees generated, which mean that on each new deposit from your referrals, you will <b>earn more reward</b>,
 so the more people you invite, the more you are <b>winning</b>.

- Basically, you just need to <a target="_blank" href="#">get your referral link from our front website</a> which is uniquely identified through our <i>smart-contract</i> and share it to the people you know,
 this way you're address will be tagged as sponsor from this particular member and therefore <b>increase your fees bonus</b> from his deposits.
